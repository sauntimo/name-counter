# Name-counter
Node/Typescript app which demonstrates text parsing.

There are two input files included in the repo; one with a list of approximately 5,400 first names and one with the entire text of [Oliver Twist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Twist). The app counts the occurences of each name in the text of the story and writes a file with results sorted from most to least frequent. It takes around 20 seconds to run. 

### Installation
